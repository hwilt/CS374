1. I wrote a recursive descent parser for a simple language. Then used lex and yacc to create a parser according to a parse table.
2. No questions.
3. Solo.
4. Yacc/Lex stuff but most is written by me.
5. Hours spent: 10
6. I did not enjoy any part of the assignment sadly.
7. Algorithm Implementation: 100%, Code Quality: 100%, Writeup and submission: 100%
8. No concerns or comments.
